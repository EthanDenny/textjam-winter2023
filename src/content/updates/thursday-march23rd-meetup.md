<pre>there'll be a textjam meetup in the EN2036
student lab (aka <i>slab</i>) in the engineering
building on mun campus today (march 23rd) at 6pm
to show off progress and get feedback on your
submissions!

<i>we tried this last week, but alas, we live in
newfoundland and the snow decided otherwise...</i>

any and all are welcome to swing by!

(p.s. <a href="https://ctsnl.ca/news/2023/03/02/meetup-new-location.html">come to cts</a> afterwards at 7 on the third floor of
