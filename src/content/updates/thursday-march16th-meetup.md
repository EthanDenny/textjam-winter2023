<pre>there'll be a textjam meetup in the EN2036
student lab (aka <i>slab</i>) in the engineering
building on mun campus tomorrow (march 16th)
at 6 PM to show off progress and get feedback
on your submissions

<i>this is weather permitting, since it seems
things will only be bad in the morning, mun
even if closed in the am will for sure be
open in the pm, if not you will hear from us!</i>

any and all are welcome to swing by!

(p.s. <a href="https://ctsnl.ca/news/2023/03/02/meetup-new-location.html">come to cts</a> afterwards at 7 on the third floor of
the qeii library)
