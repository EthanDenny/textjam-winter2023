<pre>i have spent most of my time building this actual site,
and not enough time ideating my own submission...

however, i do have two things i want to do during this
three week chunk

- make something that includes a server (probably multiplayer)
- make something that is accessible via either ssh or telnet

i'm not 100% sold on what language i want to use just yet

i could go with elixir, its what i've done for the past
two advent of codes, and also for protohackers, but i
don't know if its something i want to do a jam in simply
due to being slowed down by functional programming (i'm
still working on getting good in that department .-.)

doing something with charm.sh tooling would likely be the
best choice if i want it to be accessible via ssh, however
i don't want to write go

rust would be neat, but im not as up on the rust tui/ssh libs

textualize would be a reason enough to pick python, but i also
don't want to to have the look&feel of a gui app, so maybe i
shouldn't use

regardless of what i pick, i shall make something :)</pre>
