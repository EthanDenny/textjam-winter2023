FAQ

- what's the limitation of a text-based thing jam?

  whatever you produce, must be limited to output only text
  to the users screen

  therefore a valid submission could be something that only
  reads and prints output to and from a user via the terminal,
  like a classic text-based dungeon game

  great examples are:

  - <a href="https://www.nethack.org/">NetHack</a>
  - <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a>
  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>

  basically anything related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">'interactive fiction'</a>,
  but also anything limited to a terminal / text screen that
  draws things just using characters, even if what its
  representing behind the scenes is a lot busier than just text

  it is encouraged to go 'as low as you can go' and have a
  program that works on the command line / only reads in standard
  input and output, but if you wish to reach for something higher
  level such as a website which is just text, or even a game
  engine but only writing text to screen, that's also acceptable

- what's a 'thing' jam?

  think game jam, but if you want to produce
  a non-game thing, go ahead!

  obviously creating something fun and entertaining
  is encouraged, but if you would rather work on
  a neat tool rather than a game, that will still
  be a valid submission

- i'm quite new to programming, i'm not sure if i can do this...

  even the following python code:

    name = input("who are you:")
    print("hello, " + name)

  can be considered a valid submission to this jam!

  feel free to do as little or as much as you want

- why is the jam so long!

  for those that want a lot of time to build something
  large over a 3 week timespan, they can, but if someone
  only wants to take a weekend to bang something together,
  they'll have 3 weekends to pick from to participate
